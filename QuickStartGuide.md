# Quick Start Guide:
1. Make sure you have git installed on your machine. If you’re
unsure, go here:

it
2. Download Python from the microsoft store
3. Clone the Easy Artistry Repo
4. Run webui.bat . If you have windows and a dedicated GPU,
you can simply double click on the file. Otherwise, learn
to run it from the command line.
5. The startup process will take some time, especially on the
first go. But it will eventually open up into a web browser
window.
6. Play Around! We recommend selecting the “general” preset
from the dropdown menu and generating some images.


## Troubleshooting:
- If you get a “can’t install —------ “ error, make sure git
is correctly installed.
- If you do not have a GPU, you can run it from the command
line with the argument --skip-torch-cuda-test
- If it cannot find the correct version of python, first
attempt to reinstall the repo. If that does not work,
download the version of python it requires and then rename
it to whatever version it says it can’t find.
