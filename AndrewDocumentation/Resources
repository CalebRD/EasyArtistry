Reactive JavaScript with Stable Diffusion

	   -  I used this website to learn the basics of APIs as well as how they can be used with different programs

Electron Resources
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1K0Mb-rLBU&list=TLPQMTMwMjIwMjQ1bwltAAGCdA&index=8&ab_channel=TheLinuxExperiment
	   -  This is a very interesting video about the pros and cons of electron. I found this video to be incredibly helpful when we were still trying to decide which frameworks we can use. 
	   -  We partially decided to use electron for this project instead of React because of the advantages brought up in this video.
	https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/ 
	   -  This is all the documentation for electron
	https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
	   -  This link provides a step by step tutorial on how to create and electron app using electron forge
	https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start 
	   -  This website provides a tutorial for how to create a simpler, more primitive electron app
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML743nrkMHw&ab_channel=TraversyMedia
	   -  This video also provides a tutorial to make and use an electron app. This was incredibly helpful for me because I find it easier to learn by watching someone else do it. 
	   -  Each of these three tutorials make slightly different electron apps, varying in functionality and complexity

	   -  I had trouble using npm while trying to follow the previous tutorials, this website was very helpful in fixing my problem

Inspirations - The following websites have certain creative and functional properties that I liked and will be drawing inspiration from
	https://replicate.com/
	   -  I very much like this site’s choice to show the user a small part of the code and I would like to implement that in our project
	https://creator.nightcafe.studio/
	   -  I very much liked the general setup of this site. Not so much the color scheme but the general organization of features (art in the middle, text prompt on the side, etc.)
	   -  I did not the like amount of pop-ups this site has, I will be sure to limit those in our program
	https://openart.ai/home
	   -  I like that this site offered many clearly defined options for how to use it (such as sketch-to-image, GIFs, and video animation)
	https://www.craiyon.com/
	   -  This site provides the option of “negative words” which allows the user limit features (entering “blue” makes the image have less blue). I will be sure to implement this in our code.
