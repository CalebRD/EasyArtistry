# EasyArtistry
Easy Artistry is a tool intended to aid small artists and indie studios in developing larger projects using AI image generation. The tool will consist of a desktop application that uses artist-centric features to allow image generation engines to be able to iterate on, modify, and aid in creation of artist's original works. Easy Artistry is not intended to replace human artists, but instead to expand the scope of what an already skilled artist can accomplish with a smaller amount of time and budget. Our hope is to allow individuals to create animations, comics, and concept art, as well as small studios to create films. 

Our goals this semester is to build a prototype desktop app, with our main features in place. Primarily, we want to be able to generate and modify images with StableDiffusion, in a way that prevents direct publication. Our stretch goals (which are looking more achievable given the unexpectedly large size of our team!) are to begin allowing users to pay the bare minimum required to generate the images over the internet, allow users to change the image generation model to one of their choice, and to begin training our own, more ethical, image generation model. 

Stack: Our current plan is to use python for both front and back end, and StableDiffusion as our starter model. However, this is subject to change as our needs change, and we learn more.
