The following is a to-do list of various features that we still need to implement for this project.

GUI Mockup
- We want to put our own spin on the GUI of this application. The frontend team will work to make the site look more user-friendly. It's pretty primitive at the moment, and since
the intended users will be artist, we don't need so much information to be displayed on the screen as it is right now.

Advanced Settings Menu
- Similar to what I mentioned directly above, there are a lot of excess features and settings that don't need to be displayed on the main page. This is where we'll add an extra tab so these 
features can still be accessed, but will clean up the website a lot.
Remove Unnecessary Tabs (add to Advanced Settings)
- Some of the tabs that need to be cleaned up include: Textual Inversion, Hypernetworks, Checkpoints, Lora
Checkpoint Merger, and Train.
