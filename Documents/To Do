The following is a to-do list of various features that we still need to implement for this project.

GUI Mockup
- We want to put our own spin on the GUI of this application. The frontend team will work to make the site look more user-friendly. It's pretty primitive at the moment, and since
the intended users will be artist, we don't need so much information to be displayed on the screen as it is right now.

Advanced Settings Menu
- Similar to what I mentioned directly above, there are a lot of excess features and settings that don't need to be displayed on the main page. This is where we'll add an extra tab so these 
features can still be accessed, but will clean up the website a lot.
Remove Unnecessary Tabs (add to Advanced Settings)
- Some of the tabs that need to be cleaned up include: Textual Inversion, Hypernetworks, Checkpoints, Lora
Checkpoint Merger, and Train. 

Image to Image & Generation Tab Streamlining
- These tabs currently look very intimidating, and ask for input in areas like batch count, batch size, CFG Scale, seed, script, and more. All of these features have very specific uses that
won't necessarily be needed every time. This can be cleaned up by only including inputs for the prompt and output image size, and the rest can be placed into extra tabs and dropdown menus.

Tutorial Tab
- There are countless features that this website contains, and it would be difficult for people to understand what every tab and button do, even experienced artists might want to try something
new but won't know how to do it. That's where the tutorial tab will come in, in order to show all users how to navigate the website's various features.
